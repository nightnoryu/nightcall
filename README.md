A service for transcribing and analyzing phone calls using [OpenAI Whisper](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-base) and Llama ðŸ“ž

## Purpose

This service can be useful for companies that drive sales through phone calls. Often such companies have a call evaluation QA manager, who listens to recordings of phone calls and evaluates the performance of the sales manager. The tool will allow you to partially automate the work of the call evaluation QA.

## Building for local development
